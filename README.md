# Bike Trip Duration Prediction
This project was created in collaboration with https://github.com/makimovsky.

For this project we used [Bergen Bike Sharing Dataset (2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amykzhang/bergen-bike-sharing-dataset-2023).
## Description
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating the duration of a bike trip using different environmental and trip-related factors. The project is structured into two Jupyter Notebooks:

 - **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** The first notebook explores the dataset, performs data cleaning, and prepares the data for modeling. It includes steps such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation to ensure better model performance.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The second notebook applies and evaluates different machine learning models for predicting bike trip duration. Models tested include multiple regression, polynomial regression, decision trees, and feature selection techniques to determine the most relevant factors affecting trip duration. Performance metrics are used to compare and optimize the models.
